Though SDLC uses the term ‘Development’, it does not involve just coding tasks done by developers but also incorporates the tasks contributed by testers and stakeholders.

In SDLC, test cases are created. 
In STLC Test cases are executed. 

Testing phase in waterfall model starts only after implementation of the system is done.
Testing is done within the SDLC.

What is V- Model?
V- model is an extension of the waterfall model. Unlike the waterfall model, In V-model, there is a corresponding testing phase for each software development phase. Testing in V-model is done in parallel to SDLC stage.
Testing is done as a subproject of SDLC. 

Which Test Cases to Automate?
Test cases to be automated can be selected using the following criterion to increase the automation ROI:
High Risk - Business Critical test cases
Test cases that are repeatedly executed
Test Cases that are very tedious or difficult to perform manually
Test Cases which are time-consuming 

not suitable for automation:
Test Cases that are newly designed and not executed manually at least once
Test Cases for which the requirements are frequently changing
Test cases which are executed on an ad-hoc basis. 


---------------- Automation Testing Process:
---> Test tool selection:
Test Tool selection largely depends on the technology the Application Under Test is built on. For instance, QTP does not support Informatica. So QTP cannot be used for testing Informatica applications. It's a good idea to conduct a Proof of Concept of Tool on AUT.

---> Defining Scope of Automation:
The scope of automation is the area of your Application Under Test which will be automated. 
Following points help determine scope:
- The features that are important for the business; 
- Scenarios which have a large amount of data; 
- Common functionalities across applications; 
- Technical feasibility; 
- The extent to which business components are reused; 
- The complexity of test cases; 
- Ability to use the same test cases for cross-browser testing; 

---> Planning, Design, and Development 
During this phase, you create an Automation strategy & plan, which contains the following details: 
- Automation tools selected; 
- Framework design and its features; 
- In-Scope and Out-of-scope items of automation; 
- Automation testbed preparation; 
- Schedule and Timeline of scripting and execution; 
- Deliverables of Automation Testing; 

---> Test Execution 
Automation Scripts are executed during this phase. The scripts need input test data before they are set to run. Once executed they provide detailed test reports.
Execution can be performed using the automation tool directly or through the Test Management tool which will invoke the automation tool.
Example: Quality center is the Test Management tool which in turn it will invoke QTP for execution of automation scripts. Scripts can be executed in a single machine or a group of machines. The execution can be done during the night, to save time. 

---> Maintenance
As new functionalities are added to the System Under Test with successive cycles, Automation Scripts need to be added, reviewed and maintained for each release cycle. Maintenance becomes necessary to improve the effectiveness of Automation Scripts.

Framework for Automation 

A framework is set of automation guidelines which help in ... 
- Maintaining consistency of Testing
- Improves test structuring
- Minimum usage of code
- Less Maintenance of code 
- Improve re-usability
- Non Technical testers can be involved in code
- The training period of using the tool can be reduced
- Involves Data wherever appropriate

There are four types of frameworks used in automation software testing:
- Data Driven Automation Framework
- Keyword Driven Automation Framework
- Modular Automation Framework
- Hybrid Automation Framework

--------------------------------------------------------------- 

Automation Tool Best Practices

To get maximum ROI of automation, observe the following:
- The scope of Automation needs to be determined in detail before the start of the project. This sets expectations from Automation right.
- Select the right automation tool: A tool must not be selected based on its popularity, but it's fit to the automation requirements.
- Choose an appropriate framework
- Scripting Standards- Standards have to be followed while writing the scripts for Automation. Some of them are-
--- Create uniform scripts, comments, and indentation of the code
--- Adequate Exception handling - How error is handled on system failure or unexpected behavior of the application.
--- User-defined messages should be coded or standardized for Error Logging for testers to understand.
- Measure metrics- Success of automation cannot be determined by comparing the manual effort with the automation effort but by also capturing the following metrics: 
--- Percent of defects found
--- The time required for automation testing for each and every release cycle
--- Minimal Time is taken for release
--- Customer Satisfaction Index
--- Productivity improvement
The above guidelines if observed can greatly help in making your automation successful.

Different types of software testing that can be automated: 
Smoke Testing
Unit Testing
Integration Testing
Functional Testing
Keyword Testing
Regression Testing
Data Driven Testing
Black Box Testing

Selenium
It is a software testing tool used for Regression Testing. It is an open source testing tool that provides playback and recording facility for Regression Testing. The Selenium IDE only supports Mozilla Firefox web browser.
It provides the provision to export recorded script in other languages like Java, Ruby, RSpec, Python, C#, etc
It can be used with frameworks like JUnit and TestNG
